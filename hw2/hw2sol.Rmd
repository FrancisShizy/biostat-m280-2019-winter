## Q2.FizzBuzz Test
The R Script is showed as below: 
```{r}
fizzbuzz <- function(x){
  for (i in x){
    if (i %% 3 == 0 & i %% 5 == 0) {print("FizzBuzz")}
      else if (i %% 5 == 0){print("Buzz")}
      else if (i %% 3 == 0){print("Fizz")}
      else print(i)
  }
}

dat <- c(1:100)
fizzbuzz(dat)
```
**Implementation**
Generally, we need creat a fuction "fizzbuzz" to describe the requirements correctly. First, a **for** loop is neeeded to choose every input value in a list of numbers. Within the **for** loop, there are four cases with each **if** phrase to realize it. In the first case, if the input is a multible of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz"; if the number is a multible of five, print "Buzz"; if the number is a multible of three, print "Fizz"; For other numbers, print the original values.
